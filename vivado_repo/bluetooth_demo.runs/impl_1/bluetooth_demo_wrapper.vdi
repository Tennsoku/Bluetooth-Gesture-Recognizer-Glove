WARNING: [DRC CFGBVS-1] Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties: Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.

If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
WARNING: [DRC DPOP-2] MREG Output pipelining: DSP bluetooth_demo_i/sensor_fusion_axi_0/inst/sensor_fusion_inst/uacl_wrapper/z_sq multiplier stage bluetooth_demo_i/sensor_fusion_axi_0/inst/sensor_fusion_inst/uacl_wrapper/z_sq/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net bluetooth_demo_i/hex_display_controll_0/inst/uclk_divider/count_reg[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin bluetooth_demo_i/hex_display_controll_0/inst/uclk_divider/count[2]_i_2/O, cell bluetooth_demo_i/hex_display_controll_0/inst/uclk_divider/count[2]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC PLHOLDVIO-2] Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations: A LUT bluetooth_demo_i/hex_display_controll_0/inst/uclk_divider/count[2]_i_2 is driving clock pin of 3 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    bluetooth_demo_i/hex_display_controll_0/inst/ucounter/count_reg[0] {FDRE}
    bluetooth_demo_i/hex_display_controll_0/inst/ucounter/count_reg[1] {FDRE}
    bluetooth_demo_i/hex_display_controll_0/inst/ucounter/count_reg[2] {FDRE}
